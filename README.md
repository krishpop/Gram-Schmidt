# Gram-Schmidt

## CPSC 440 Numerical Computation Assignment: Implementing a double Gram-Schmidt inversion in C

This program utilizes the [Gram-Schmidt process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramâ€“Schmidt_process) to 
orthonormalize a set of vectors in an n*n matrix (there are n vectors, where each column in the matrix
corresponds to one of the vectors).

It then uses resulting matrix to find the inverse of the original input matrix. It returns both the
inverse as well as the orthonormalized matrices.

See the included HW1.pdf (it is just a page) for a clearer understanding of the function.
